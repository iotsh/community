# Iot - SmartHome

![Overview](./images/README/iotsh.png)

----
With the development of Internet of Things technology, smart homes have 
gradually entered the public's field of vision. Today's smart home 
ecosystem is led by several business giants, providing users with a safe and 
complete experience. But these ecology are not personally integrated, 
which is not a good thing for Geek who wants to develop some small smart devices.

So we launched this open source project. This project aims to provide 
a complete connection between smart home manufacturers and smart devices,
maximizing the burden on smart device enthusiasts.
